I'll help create a plan for implementing the video upload and conversion feature. Let's break this down into manageable steps:

1. **UI/Navigation Setup**
   - Add a new video upload tab in the tab navigation
   - Create a video upload screen with proper UI components
   - Add video picker functionality using Expo's media library

2. **Video Upload Flow**
   - Implement video selection from device
   - Add video preview capability
   - Create upload progress indicator
   - Handle large file uploads efficiently
   - Implement basic video metadata input (title, description, etc.)

3. **OpenShot Cloud API Integration**
   - Research and document OpenShot Cloud API endpoints for video conversion
   - Create API wrapper for OpenShot Cloud services
   - Handle authentication and API keys securely
   - Implement 16:9 to 9:16 conversion request

4. **Backend Storage**
   - Set up Firebase Storage for video files
   - Create proper storage structure
   - Implement upload/download functionality
   - Handle video processing status tracking

5. **Processing Flow**
   1. User selects 16:9 video
   2. Upload to Firebase Storage
   3. Send to OpenShot Cloud for conversion
   4. Store converted 9:16 video
   5. Make available in app

Let me start by checking your current tab structure:

Read file: app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx


Let's start with step 1 - adding the video upload tab. Would you like me to:

1. Create a new video upload tab with basic UI
2. Add the necessary Expo packages for video handling
3. Set up the initial video upload screen structure

Which part would you like me to implement first?

Also, do you have any specific preferences for:
- The tab icon for video upload
- The position of the tab in the navigation
- Any specific UI requirements for the upload screen
- Maximum video file size limitations

Let me know your preferences and I'll start implementing the chosen part!
